Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis
This project focused on leveraging data analytics to extract actionable business insights from a Zomato restaurant dataset. Using a structured approach, I performed end-to-end data management and analysis, from cleaning and preparation to visualization.

Key Responsibilities & Methods:

Data Acquisition & Hygiene: I successfully resolved data import issues from a raw CSV file into a PostgreSQL database, a critical step that involved troubleshooting syntax errors and managing file paths. This ensured the dataset was properly structured for analysis.

Data Analysis with SQL: I used SQL to query the database and answer key business questions. This included calculating average restaurant ratings by location and restaurant type, identifying top-performing restaurant chains, and determining restaurant density in specific areas.

Data Visualization & Reporting: I connected the clean dataset to Power BI to create interactive dashboards. This allowed for visual representation of key findings, such as the relationship between a restaurant's type and its average cost, and the distribution of restaurant types.

Results & Impact:

The analysis provided a clear picture of the restaurant landscape, identifying top-performing businesses and key success factors. The findings can be used to provide data-driven recommendations to restaurant owners, such as offering popular cuisines, implementing online ordering, and leveraging promotional coupon codes to boost business. This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and the use of business intelligence tools for strategic decision-making.
